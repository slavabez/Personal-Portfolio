## About me

My name is Slava Bezgachev and I am a full stack web developer with 3+ years of commercial experience. Lately I've been focusing on mastering Javascript with ReactJS on the front-end with NodeJS on the back-end.

## Skills and technologies

- **Javascript.**
  I've been using Javascript both in the browser and with Node for many years. Not without it's quirks, it's my favourite language for a lot of things. The technologies I've used.
  - **ES6 and ES7.**
    The latest and greatest of Javascript
  - **ReactJS.**
    React is my go-to framework for almost any front-end site because of how fast it is.
  - **NodeJS.**
    I use Node, usually with Express because it works well with the web due to it's event-driven architecture.
  - **Various libraries and frameworks.**
    Over the years I've used a plethora of NPM libraries and frameworks, for such purposes as security, monitoring, maintenance or styling.
- **Other programming languages.**
Over the years I've used a lot of programming languages, some for a long time and others for a little while. I've used **PHP** and **.NET** commercially, as well as **Java, C++ and Go** in my own time on personal projects.
- **Databases.**
I've used both SQL databases, including MySQL and MSSQL, as well as MongoDB, a no-SQL database.
- **Redis.**
  Redis is a great and simple in-memory data storage. I typically put it between the Node server and the database, like MongoDB, to serve as a caching layer
